# ================= Compulsory Task 2 ==================
# Create a new Python file in this folder called hash.py
# Think about three celebrities/famous people that you know.
# Create a dictionary called hotMap, where the the KEYS are the name and surname of the person (i.e. a String), and the VALUE for each key is either the String 'hot' or 'not',
# based on whether you think that person is hot or not!
# For Example:
#    hotMap = {
#        'EmmaWatson': 'Hot',
#        'JustinBieber': 'Not',
#        'LeoDiCaprio': 'Hot',
#    }
#    What does print hotMap['EmmaWatson'] return?

hotMap = {
        'EmmaWatson': 'Hot',
        'JustinBieber': 'Not',
        'LeoDiCaprio': 'Hot',
    }

print(hotMap['EmmaWatson'])
