# Create a new Python file in this folder called “baby.py” 
# This program will be used to test if the user is over 18 and allowed entry into a party.
# Ask the user to enter the year they were born and calculate if they are older than 18.
# If they are older then display a message saying "congrates you are old enough"

age = int(input("Please enter your age: \n"))
if age > 18:
    print ("Congrats you are old enough!")
